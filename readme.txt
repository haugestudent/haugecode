Testing Git hub repositories
If you are reading this and do not find it to be of any interest,
don't blame me.  I never told you to come here in the first place.

I am not trying to be rude.  I am a friendly guy, I really am.  You
would probably like me if we had a beer in a pub.

I would also like to add that I am very fond of bell peppers and chili.
